# ThermoBreeze

ThermoBreeze is an Arduino-based system that automatically adjusts fan speed based on real-time temperature readings. Using sensors like LM35 or DHT11, it monitors the environment and regulates fan speed via PWM signals for efficient cooling. The system features an LCD display for real-time temperature and fan speed updates and allows customizable temperature thresholds. With built-in overheat protection, ThermoBreeze is ideal for energy-efficient cooling in electronics, server rooms, and home ventilation systems.
